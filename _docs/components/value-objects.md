### Definition & Principles

Value Objects are simple Objects, pretty similar to Models, but they do not get stored in the DB, thus they don't have ID's.

A Value Object is an immutable object that is defined by its encapsulated attributes. 
We create Value Object when we need it to represent/serve/manipulate some data (attached as attributes), and w'll kill it later when we finish using it, to recreate it again when needed.  

<a name="rules"></a>
### Rules

- All Models MUST extend from `App\Ship\Parents\ValueObject\ValueObject`.

### Folder Structure

```
 - App
    - Containers
        - {container-name}
            - ValueObjects
                - Output.php
                - Region.php
                - ...
```

### Code Sample

```php
<?php

use App\Ship\Parents\ValueObject\ValueObject;

class Location extends ValueObject
{
    private $x = null;
    
    private $y = null;

    protected $resourceKey = 'localoca';
    
    public function __construct($x, $y)
    {
        $this->x = $x;
        $this->y = $y;
    }

    public function getCoordinatesAsString()
    {
        return $this->x . ' - ' . $this->y;
    }
}
```
